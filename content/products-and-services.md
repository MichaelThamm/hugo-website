### Our products

The products we use are natural and authentic products ordered from [vasariplaster.com](https://vasariplaster.com/). Other cheaper suppliers may use plasters and paints with synthetic filler, but not us! We use natural, non fading,
pigments for coloring, and welcome using your choice of acrylic paint color.

### Our services

__Cost__: $5 to $30 per square foot.

__Factors__ that affect the cost of Venetian plastering:
- The size of the project
- The type of application
- The materials used
- The complexity of the work/design
- Custom colors

__Consultation__: We offer a free consultation within the Windsor area.

__Warranty__: We warrant our work within 10 years.

__Repairs__: We offer no charge for repairs required due to the quality of our work, but
might charge for stains or chips. This depends on the extent of the work and will require a quote on a case-by-case basis.
